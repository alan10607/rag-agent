Vector Search and Semantic Similarity

Vector search is a technique used in information retrieval that represents data as high-dimensional vectors and finds similar items by measuring the distance between these vectors. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, vector search captures the semantic meaning of text, enabling more intelligent and context-aware results.

How Embeddings Work

Text embeddings are dense numerical representations of text generated by machine learning models. These models, such as sentence-transformers, convert words, sentences, or entire documents into fixed-length vectors in a continuous vector space. Texts with similar meanings are mapped to nearby points in this space, even if they use completely different words.

For example, the sentences "The cat sat on the mat" and "A feline rested on the rug" would have very similar embeddings despite sharing no common words, because their semantic meaning is nearly identical.

Applications of Vector Search

Vector search has numerous practical applications across many domains:

1. Semantic Document Search: Finding relevant documents based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. This is particularly useful for research, legal discovery, and knowledge management.

2. Recommendation Systems: Suggesting similar products, articles, or content to users based on the vector similarity of items they have previously interacted with.

3. Image Search: Using visual embeddings to find similar images, even when metadata or tags are unavailable.

4. Question Answering: Retrieving the most relevant passages from a knowledge base to answer user questions.

5. Duplicate Detection: Identifying near-duplicate content across large datasets by comparing vector similarities.

Qdrant Vector Database

Qdrant is an open-source vector similarity search engine designed for production-ready applications. It provides a convenient API for storing, searching, and managing vectors with additional payload data. Key features include:

- High Performance: Optimized for speed with HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing.
- Filtering: Supports payload-based filtering to narrow search results.
- Scalability: Designed to handle millions of vectors with distributed deployment options.
- Rich API: REST and gRPC interfaces for integration with any programming language.

Chunking Strategies

When processing large documents for vector search, it is essential to split them into smaller chunks. This is because embedding models have token limits, and smaller chunks tend to produce more focused and accurate embeddings. Common chunking strategies include:

- Fixed-size chunking: Splitting text into equal-length segments.
- Recursive character splitting: Using a hierarchy of separators (paragraphs, sentences, words) to find natural break points.
- Semantic chunking: Using the embedding model itself to determine optimal split points based on topic changes.

The choice of chunk size involves a trade-off: smaller chunks are more precise but may lose context, while larger chunks retain more context but may dilute the relevance signal.
